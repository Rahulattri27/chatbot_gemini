The potential ofrenewable energy sources is enormous as they can in principle meet many\\ntimes the world’s energy demand. Renewable energy sources such as biomass,\\nwind, solar, hydropower, and geothermal can provide sustainable energyservices, based on the use of routinely available, indigenous resources.Renewable energy sources currently supply somewhere between 15 percentand 20 percent of world’s total energy demand. The supply is dominated bytraditional biomass, mostly fuel wood used for cooking and heating,especially in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Amajor contribution is also obtained from the use of large hydropower; withnearly 20 percent of the global electricity supply being provided by thissource. New renewable energy sources (solar energy, wind energy, modernbio-energy, geothermal energy, and small hydropower) are currentlycontributing about two percent.

INTRODUCTION\\nRenewable Energy RE is any form of energy from solar, geophysical or\\nbiological sources that is replenished by natural processes at a rate thatequals or exceeds its rate of use. RE is obtained from the continuing orrepetitive flows of energy occurring in the natural environment and includesresources such as biomass, solar energy, geothermal heat, hydropower,tide and waves, ocean thermal energy and wind energy. However, it ispossible to utilize biomass at a greater rate than it can grow or to drawheat from a geothermal field at a faster rate than heat flows can replenishit. On the other hand, the rate of utilization of direct solar energy has nobearing on the rate at which it reaches the Earth. Fossil fuels (coal, oil,natural gas) do not fall under this definition, as they are not replenishedwithin a time frame that is short relative to their rate of utilization.\\nRenewable energy sources are often considered alternative sources\\nbecause, in general, most industrialized countries do not rely on them astheir main energy source. Instead, they tend to rely on non-renewablesources such as fossil fuels or nuclear power. Because the energy crisis inthe United States during the 1970s, dwindling supplies of fossil fuels andhazards associated with nuclear power, usage of renewable energy sourcessuch as solar energy, hydroelectric, wind, biomass, and geothermal hasgrown.\\nRenewable energy comes from the sun (considered an “unlimited” supply)\\nor other sources that can theoretically be renewed at least as quickly as\\nthey are consumed. If used at a sustainable rate, these sources will beavailable for consumption for thousands of years or longer. Unfortunately,some potentially renewable energy sources, such as biomass andgeothermal, are actually being depleted in some areas because the usagerate exceeds the renewal rate. Fig. 1, shows paths of energy from source toservice\\n[1-4].\\n2. WHY RENEWABLE ENERGY?\\nToday we primarily use fossil fuels to heat and power our homes and fuelour cars. It’s convenient to use coal, oil, and natural gas for meeting ourenergy needs, but we have a limited supply of these fuels on the Earth.We’re using them much more rapidly than they are being created.Eventually, they will run out. And because of safety concerns and wastedisposal problems, the United States will retire much of its nuclear capacityby 2020. In the meantime, the nation’s energy needs are expected to growby 33 percent during the next 20 years. Renewable energy can help fill thegap. Even if we had an unlimited supply of fossil fuels, using renewableenergy is better for the environment.

Climate\\nscientists generally agree that the Earth’s average temperature has risenin the past century. If this trend continues, sea levels will rise, and scientistspredict that floods, heat waves, droughts, and other extreme weatherconditions could occur more often. Other pollutants are released into theair, soil, and water when fossil fuels are burned. These pollutants take adramatic toll on the environment and on humans. Air pollution contributesto diseases like asthma. Acid rain from sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxidesharms plants and fish. Nitrogen oxides also contribute to smog.\\nRenewable energy will also help us develop energy independence and\\nsecurity. Replacing some of our petroleum with fuels made from plantmatter, for example, could save money and strengthen our energysecurity\\n[5,6].\\n3. SOLAR ENERGY\\nSolar energy is the ultimate energy source driving the earth. Though onlyone billionth of the energy that leaves the sun actually reaches the earth’ssurface, this is more than enough to meet the world’s energy requirements.In fact, all other sources of energy, renewable and non-renewable, are\\nactually stored forms of solar energy. The process of directly converting\\nsolar energy to heat or electricity is considered a renewable energy source.Solar energy represents an essentially unlimited supply of energy as thesun will long outlast human civilization on earth. The difficulties lie inharnessing the energy. Solar energy has been used for centuries to heathomes and water, and modern technology (photovoltaic cells) has provideda way to produce electricity from sunlight. There are two basic forms ofradiant solar energy use: passive and active.\\nPassive solar energy systems are static, and do not require the input of\\nenergy in the form of moving parts or pumping fluids to utilize the sun’senergy. Buildings can be designed to capture and collect the sun’s energydirectly. Materials are selected for their special characteristics: glass allowsthe sun to enter the building to provide light and heat; water and stonematerials have high heat capacities. They can absorb large amounts ofsolar energy during the day, which can then be used during the night. Asouthern exposure greenhouse with glass windows and a concrete floor isan example of a passive solar heating system.\\nActive solar energy systems require the input of some energy to drive\\nmechanical devices ( e.g., solar panels), which collect the energy and pump\\nfluids used to store and distribute the energy. Solar panels are generallymounted on a south or west-facing roof. A solar panel usually consists of a\\nglass-faced, sealed, insulated box with a black matte interior finish. Inside'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Ch-12greenenergy.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='320 Energy Sci. & Tech. Vol. 1: Opportunities and Challenges\\nare coils full of a heat collecting liquid medium (usually water, sometimes\\naugmented by antifreeze). The sun heats the water in the coils, which is\\npumped to coils in a heat transfer tank containing water. The water in thetank is heated and then either stored or pumped through the building toheat rooms or supply hot water to taps in the building.\\nPhotovoltaic cells generate electricity from sunlight. Hundreds of cells\\nare linked together to provide the required flow of current. The electricitycan be used directly or stored in storage batteries. Because photovoltaiccells have no moving parts, they are clean, quiet, and durable. Earlyphotovoltaic cells were extremely expensive, making the cost of solar electricpanels prohibitive. The recent development of inexpensive semiconductormaterials has helped greatly lower the cost to the point where solar electricpanels can compete much better cost wise with traditionally-producedelectricity.\\nThough solar energy itself is free, large costs can be associated with the\\nequipment. The building costs for a house heated by passive solar energymay initially be more expensive. The glass, stone materials, and excellentinsulation necessary for the system to work properly tend to be more costlythan conventional building materials. A long-term comparison of utilitybills, though, generally reveals noticeable savings. The solar panels usedin active solar energy can be expensive to purchase, install and maintain.\\nLeaks can occur in the extensive network of pipes required, thereby causing\\nadditional expense. The biggest drawback of any solar energy system isthat it requires a consistent supply of sunlight to work. Most parts of theworld have less than ideal conditions for a solar-only home because of theirlatitude or climate. Therefore, it is usually necessary for solar houses tohave conventional backup systems ( e.g. a gas furnace or hot-water heater).\\nThis double-system requirement further adds to its cost\\n[2],[4],[5]&[6].\\n3.1. Photovoltaic Systems\\nA photovoltaic system is composed of the PV module, as well as the balanceof system (BOS) components, which include an inverter, storage devices,charge controller, system structure, and the energy network. The systemmust be reliable, cost effective, attractive and match with the electric gridin the future.\\nAt the component level, BOS components for grid-connected applications\\nare not yet sufficiently developed to match the lifetime of PV modules.Additionally, BOS component and installation costs need to be reduced.\\nMoreover, devices for storing large amounts of electricity (over 1 MWh\\nor 3,600 MJ) will be adapted to large PV systems in the new energy network.As new module technologies emerge in the future, some of the ideas relating\\nto BOS may need to be revised. Furthermore, the quality of the system'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Ch-12greenenergy.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content=' 321 Green Energy - An Introduction\\nneeds to be assured and adequately maintained according to defined\\nstandards, guidelines and procedures. To ensure system quality, assessing\\nperformance is important, including on-line analysis ( e.g., early fault\\ndetection) and off-line analysis of PV systems. The knowledge gatheredcan help to validate software for predicting the energy yield of future moduleand system technology designs.\\nTo increasingly penetrate the energy network, PV systems must use\\ntechnology that is compatible with the electric grid and energy supply anddemand. System designs and operation technologies must also be developedin response to demand patterns by developing technology to forecast thepower generation volume and to optimize the storage function.\\nMoreover, inverters must improve the quality of grid electricity by\\ncontrolling reactive power or filtering harmonics with communication in anew energy network that uses a mixture of inexpensive and effectivecommunications systems and technologies, as well as smart meters.Photovoltaic applications include PV power systems classified into twomajor types: those not connected to the traditional power grid ( i.e., off-grid\\napplications) and those that are connected ( i.e., grid-connected applications).\\nIn addition, there is a much smaller, but stable, market segment for\\nconsumer applications.\\nOff-grid PV systems have a significant opportunity for economic\\napplication in the un-electrified areas of developing countries. Of the totalcapacity installed in these countries during 2009, only about 1.2% wasinstalled in off-grid systems that now make up 4.2% of the cumulativeinstalled PV capacity of the IEA PVPS countries.\\nOff-grid centralized PV mini-grid systems have become a reliable\\nalternative for village electrification over the last few years. In a PV mini-grid system, energy allocation is possible. For a village located in an isolatedarea and with houses not separated by too great a distance, the power mayflow in the mini-grid without considerable losses\\n[2],[4],[5]&[6].\\n4. HYDROELECTRIC ENERGY\\nHydroelectric power is generated by using the energy of flowing water topower generating turbines for producing electricity. Most hydroelectricpower is generated by dams across large-flow rivers. A dam built acrossriver creates a reservoir behind it. The height of the water behind the damis greater than that below the dam, representing stored potential energy.When water flows down through the penstock of the dam, driving theturbines, some of this potential energy is converted into electricity.\\nHydroelectric power, like other alternative sources, is clean and relatively\\ncheap over the long term even with initial construction costs and upkeep.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Ch-12greenenergy.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='322 Energy Sci. & Tech. Vol. 1: Opportunities and Challenges\\nBut because the river’s normal flow rate is reduced by the dam, sediments\\nnormally carried downstream by the water are instead deposited in the\\nreservoir. Eventually, the sediment can clog the penstocks and render thedam useless for power generation.\\nLarge-scale dams can have a significant impact on the regional\\nenvironment. When the river is initially dammed, farmlands are sometimesflooded and entire populations of people and wildlife are displaced by therising waters behind the dam. In some cases, the reservoir can floodhundreds or thousands of square kilometres. The decreased flowdownstream from the dam can also negatively impact human and wildlifepopulations living downstream. In addition, the dam can act as a barrierto fish that must travel upstream to spawn. Aquatic organisms arefrequently caught and killed in the penstock and the out-take pipes. Becauseof the large surface area of the reservoir, the local climate can change dueto the large amount of evaporation occurring.\\nThe total worldwide technical potential for hydropower generation is\\n14,576 TWh/yr (52.47 EJ/yr) with a corresponding installed capacity of3,721 GW, roughly four times the current installed capacity. Worldwidetotal installed hydropower capacity in 2009 was 926 GW, producing annualgeneration of 3,551 TWh/y (12.8 EJ/y), and representing a global averagecapacity factor of 44%. Of the total technical potential for hydropower,\\nundeveloped capacity ranges from about 47% in Europe and North America\\nto 92% in Africa, which indicates large opportunities for continuedhydropower development worldwide, with the largest growth potential inAfrica, Asia and Latin America. Additionally, possible renovation,modernization and upgrading of old power stations are often less costlythan developing a new power plant, have relatively smaller environmentand social impacts, and require less time for implementation. Significantpotential also exists to rework existing infrastructure that currently lacksgenerating units ( e.g., existing barrages, weirs, dams, canal fall structures,\\nwater supply schemes) by adding new hydropower facilities.\\nOnly 25% of the existing 45,000 large dams are used for hydropower,\\nwhile the other 75% are used exclusively for other purposes ( e.g., irrigation,\\nflood control, navigation and urban water supply schemes). Climate changeis expected to increase overall average precipitation and runoff, but regionalpatterns will vary: the impacts on hydropower generation are likely to besmall on a global basis, but significant regional changes in river flowvolumes and timing may pose challenges for planning.\\nHydropower can provide important services to electric power systems.\\nStorage hydropower plants can often be operated flexibly, and thereforeare valuable to electric power systems. Specifically, with its rapid responseload-following and balancing capabilities, peaking capacity and power\\nquality attributes, hydropower can play an important role in ensuring'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Ch-12greenenergy.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content=' 323 Green Energy - An Introduction\\nreliable electricity service. In an integrated system, reservoir and pumped\\nstorage hydropower can be used to reduce the frequency of start-ups and\\nshutdowns of thermal plants; to maintain a balance between supply anddemand under changing demand or supply patterns and thereby reducethe load following burden of thermal plants; and to increase the amount oftime that thermal units are operated at their maximum thermal efficiency,thereby reducing carbon emissions. In addition, storage and pumped storagehydropower can help reduce the challenges of integrating variablerenewable resources such as wind, solar photovoltaics, and wave power\\n[2],[4].\\n4.1. Environmental and Social Impacts\\nAlthough hydroelectricity is generally considered a clean energy source, itis not totally devoid of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and it can oftenhave significant adverse socio-economic impacts. There are arguments nowthat large-scale dams actually do not reduce overall GHG emissions whencompared to fossil fuel power plant. To build a dam significant amounts ofland need to be flooded often in densely inhabited rural area, involvinglarge displacements of usually poor, indigenous peoples. Mitigating suchsocial impacts represents a significant cost to the project, which if it iseven taken into consideration, often not done in the past, can make theproject economically and socially unviable. Environmental concerns are\\nalso quite significant, as past experience has shown. This includes reduction\\nin biodiversity and fish populations, sedimentation that can greatly reducedam efficiency and destroy the river habitat, poor water quality, and thespread of water-related diseases. In fact, in the U.S. several large powerproduction dams are being decommissioned due to their negativeenvironmental impacts. Properly addressing these issues would result inan enormous escalation of the overall costs for producing hydropowermaking it far less competitive than is usually stated. As many countriesmove toward an open electricity market this fact will come into play whendecisions regarding investments in new energy sources are being made. Ifthe large hydro industry is to survive it needs to come to grips with its poorrecord of both cost estimation and project implementation\\n[1].\\n5. WIND POWER\\nWind is the result of the sun’s uneven heating of the atmosphere. Warmair expands and rises, and cool air contracts and sinks. This movement ofthe air is called wind. Wind has been used as an energy source for millennia.It has been used to pump water, to power ships, and to mill grains.\\nAreas with constant and strong winds can be used by wind turbines to\\ngenerate electricity. Wind energy does not produce air pollution, can be\\nvirtually limitless, and is relatively inexpensive to produce. There is an'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Ch-12greenenergy.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='324 Energy Sci. & Tech. Vol. 1: Opportunities and Challenges\\ninitial cost of manufacturing the wind turbine and the costs associated\\nwith upkeep and repairs, but the wind itself is free.\\nThe major drawbacks of wind-powered generators are they require lots\\nof open land and a fairly constant wind supply. Windmills are also noisy,and some people consider them aesthetically unappealing and label themas visual pollution. Migrating birds and insects can become entangled andkilled by the turning blades. However, the land used for windmill farmscan be simultaneously used for other purposes such as ranching, farmingand recreation\\n[1],[2]&[4].\\n5.1. Technology and Applications\\nModern, commercial grid-connected wind turbines have evolved from small,simple machines to large, highly sophisticated devices. Scientific andengineering expertise and advances, as well as improved computationaltools, design standards, manufacturing methods, and O&M procedures,have all supported these technology developments. As a result, typical windturbine nameplate capacity ratings have increased dramatically since the1980s (from roughly 75 kW to 1.5 MW and larger), while the cost of windenergy has substantially declined. Onshore wind energy technology isalready being manufactured and deployed on a commercial basis.Nonetheless, additional R&D advances are anticipated, and are expected\\nto further reduce the cost of wind energy while enhancing system and\\ncomponent performance and reliability. Offshore wind energy technology\\nis still developing, with greater opportunities for additional advancement.\\nSpecifically, modern large wind turbines typically employ rotors that\\nstart extracting energy from the wind at speeds of roughly 3 to 4 m/s. Awind turbine increases power production with wind speed until it reachesits rated power level, often corresponding to a wind speed of 11 to 15 m/s.At still-higher wind speeds, control systems limit power output to preventoverloading the wind turbine, either through stall control, pitching theblades, or a combination of both. Most turbines then stop producing energyat wind speeds of approximately 20 to 25 m/s to limit loads on the rotor andprevent damage to the turbine’s structural components.\\nWind turbine design has centered on maximizing energy capture over\\nthe range of wind speeds experienced by wind turbines, while seeking tominimize the cost of wind energy. Increased generator capacity leads togreater energy capture when the turbine is operating at rated power. Largerrotor diameters for a given generator capacity, meanwhile, as well asaerodynamic design improvements, yield greater energy capture at lowerwind speeds, reducing the wind speed at which rated power is achieved.Variable speed operation allows energy extraction at peak efficiency over\\na wider range of wind speeds. Finally, because the average wind speed at a'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Ch-12greenenergy.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content=' 325 Green Energy - An Introduction\\ngiven location varies with the height above ground level, taller towers\\ntypically lead to increased energy capture. To minimize cost, wind turbine\\ndesign is also motivated by a desire to reduce materials usage whilecontinuing to increase turbine size, increase component and systemreliability, and improve wind power plant operations. A system-level designand analysis approach is necessary to optimize wind turbine technology,power plant installation and O&M procedures for individual turbines andentire wind power plants.\\nMoreover, optimizing turbine and power plant design for specific site\\nconditions has become common as wind turbines, wind power plants andthe wind energy market have all increased in size; site-specific conditionsthat can impact turbine and plant design include geographic and temporalvariations in wind speed, site topography and access, interactions amongindividual wind turbines due to wake effects, and integration into the largerelectricity system. Wind turbine and power plant design also impacts andis impacted by noise, visual, environmental and public acceptance issues\\n[1].\\n5.2. Regional and National Status and Trends\\nThe countries with the highest total installed wind power capacity by theend of 2009 were the USA (35 GW), China (26 GW), Germany (26 GW),Spain (19 GW) and India (11 GW). After its initial start in the USA in the\\n1980s, wind energy growth centered on countries in the EU and India during\\nthe 1990s and the early 2000s. In the late 2000s, however, the USA and\\nthen China became the locations for the greatest annual capacity additionsas shown in Fig. 2\\n[1][4].\\n6. BIOMASS ENERGY\\nBiomass is the term used for all organic material originating from plantsincluding algae, trees and crops and is essentially the collection and storage\\nof the sun’s energy through photosynthesis. Biomass energy, or bioenergy,Fig. 2:  Top-10 countries in cumulative wind power capacity\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Ch-12greenenergy.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='326 Energy Sci. & Tech. Vol. 1: Opportunities and Challenges\\nis the conversion of biomass into useful forms of energy such as heat,\\nelectricity and liquid fuels.\\nBiomass for bioenergy comes either directly from the land, as dedicated\\nenergy crops, or from residues generated in the processing of crops for foodor other products such as pulp and paper from the wood industry. Anotherimportant contribution is from post consumer residue streams such asconstruction and demolition wood, pellets used in transportation, and theclean fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW). The biomass to bioenergysystem can be considered as the management of flow of solar generatedmaterials, food, and fiber in our society. These interrelationships are shownin Fig. 3, which presents the various resource types and applications,showing the flow of their harvest and residues to bioenergy applications.Not all biomass is directly used to produce energy but rather it can beconverted into intermediate energy carriers called biofuels. This includescharcoal (higher energy density solid fuel), ethanol (liquid fuel), or producer-gas (from gasification of biomass)\\n[1][6].\\nFig. 3:  Biomass and bioenergy flow chart[1]\\nThe use of biomass as a fuel source has serious environmental effects.\\nWhen harvested trees are not replanted, soil erosion can occur. The loss ofphotosynthetic activity results in increased amounts of carbon dioxide inthe atmosphere and can contribute to global warming. The burning ofbiomass also produces carbon dioxide and deprives the soil of nutrients it\\nnormally would have received from the decomposition of the organic matter.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Ch-12greenenergy.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content=' 327 Green Energy - An Introduction\\nBurning releases particulate matter (such as ash) into the air which can\\ncause respiratory health problems.\\nIn 2008, biomass provided about 10% (50.3 EJ/yr) of the global primary\\nenergy supply. Major biomass uses fall into two broad categories:\\n• Low-efficiency traditional biomass such as wood, straws, dung and\\nother manures are used for cooking, lighting and space heating,generally by the poorer populations in developing countries. Thisbiomass is mostly combusted, creating serious negative impacts onhealth and living conditions. Increasingly, charcoal is becomingsecondary energy carrier in rural areas with opportunities to createproductive chains.\\n• High-efficiency modern bioenergy uses more convenient solids, liquids\\nand gases as secondary energy carriers to generate heat, electricity,combined heat and power (CHP), and transport fuels for varioussectors. Liquid biofuels include ethanol and biodiesel for global roadtransport and some industrial uses. Biomass derived gases, primarilymethane, from anaerobic digestion of agricultural residues andmunicipal solid waste (MSW) treatment are used to generate electricity,heat or both. The most important contribution to these energy servicesis based on solids, such as chips, pellets, recovered wood previouslyused and others. Heating includes space and hot water heating such\\nas in district heating systems. The estimated total primary biomass\\nsupply for modern bioenergy is 11.3 EJ/yr and the secondary energydelivered to end use consumers is roughly 6.6 EJ/yr.\\nAdditionally, the industry sector, such as the pulp and paper, forestry,\\nand food industries, consumes approximately 7.7 EJ of biomass annually,primarily as a source for industrial process steam.\\nGlobal bioenergy use has steadily grown worldwide in absolute terms\\nin the last 40 years, with large differences among countries. In 2006, Chinaled all countries and used 9 EJ of biomass for energy, followed by India (6EJ), the USA (2.3 EJ) and Brazil (2 EJ). Bioenergy provides a relativelysmall but growing share of Total Primary Energy Supply: TPES (1 to 4% in2006) in the largest industrialized countries (grouped as the G8 countries:the USA, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, Italy, the UK and Russia).The use of solid biomass for electricity production is particularly importantin pulp and paper plants and in sugar mills. Bioenergy’s share in totalenergy consumption is generally increasing in the G8 countries throughthe use of modern biomass forms ( e.g., co-combustion or co-firing for\\nelectricity generation, space heating with pellets) especially in Germany,Italy and the UK.\\nBy contrast, in 2006, bioenergy provided 5 to 27% of TPES in the largest\\ndeveloping countries (China, India, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa), mainly\\nthrough the use of traditional forms, and more than 80% of TPES in the'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Ch-12greenenergy.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='328 Energy Sci. & Tech. Vol. 1: Opportunities and Challenges\\npoorest countries. The bioenergy share in India, China and Mexico is\\ndecreasing, mostly as traditional biomass is substituted by kerosene and\\nliquefied petroleum gas within large cities. However, consumption inabsolute terms continues to grow. This trend is also true for most Africancountries, where demand has been driven by a steady increase in woodfuels, particularly in the use of charcoal in booming urban areas.\\nThree principal categories are more or less comprehensively considered\\nin assessments of biomass resource potentials:\\n• Primary residues from conventional food and fiber production in\\nagriculture and forestry, such as cereal straw and logging residues;\\n• Secondary and tertiary residues in the form of organic food/forest\\nindustry by products and retail/post consumer waste; and\\n• Plants produced for energy supply, including conventional food/fodder/\\nindustrial crops, surplus round wood forestry products, and newagricultural, forestry or aquatic plants. Given that resource potentialassessments quantify the availability of residue flows in the food andforest sectors, the definition of how these sectors develop is centralfor the outcome\\n[1].\\n6.1. Biomass Energy Conversion Technologies and Applications\\nThere are a variety of technologies for generating modern energy carrierselectricity, gas, and liquid fuels from biomass, which can be used at thehousehold (~10 kW), community (~100 kW), or industrial (~MW) scale.The different technologies tend to be classed in terms of either theconversion process they use or the end product produced\\n[1].\\n6.1.1.  Combustion\\nDirect combustion remains the most common technique for deriving energy\\nfrom biomass for both heat and electricity production. In colder climatesdomestic biomass fired heating systems are widespread and recentdevelopments have led to the application of improved heating systems whichare automated, have catalytic gas cleaning and make use of standardizedfuel (such as pellets). The efficiency benefit compared to open fireplaces isconsiderable with advanced domestic heaters obtaining efficiencies of over70 percent with greatly reduced atmospheric emissions. The application ofbiomass fired district heating is common in the Scandinavian countries,Austria, Germany and various Eastern European countries\\n[1].\\n6.1.2. Gasification\\nCombustible gas can be produced from biomass through a high temperature\\nthermochemical process. The term gasification commonly refers to this high\\ntemperature thermochemical conversion with the product gas called'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Ch-12greenenergy.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content=' 329 Green Energy - An Introduction\\nproducer-gas, and involves burning biomass without sufficient air for full\\ncombustion, but with enough air to convert the solid biomass into a gaseous\\nfuel. Producer-gas consists primarily of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, carbondioxide and nitrogen, and has a heating value of 4 to 6 MJ/Nm\\n3, or 10–15\\npercent of the heating value of natural gas. The intended use of the gasand the characteristics of the particular biomass (size, texture, moisturecontent, etc.) determine the design and operating characteristics of thegasifier and associated equipment. After appropriate treatment, theresulting gases can be burned directly for cooking or heat supply, or can beused in secondary conversion devices such as internal combustion enginesor gas turbines for producing electricity or shaft work. The systems usedcan scale from small to medium (5–100 kW), suitable for the cooking orlighting needs of a single family or community, up to large grid connectedpower generation facilities consuming several hundred of kilograms ofwoody biomass per hour and producing 10-100 MW of electricity\\n[1].\\n6.1.3.  Anaerobic digestion\\nCombustible gas can also be produced from biomass through the low\\ntemperature biological processes called anaerobic (without air) digestion.Biogas is the common name for the gas produced either in specificallydesigned anaerobic digesters or in landfills by capturing the naturallyproduced methane. Biogas is typically about 60 percent methane and 40\\npercent carbon dioxide with a heating value of about 55 percent that of\\nnatural gas. Almost any biomass except lignin (a major component of wood)can be converted to biogas animal and human wastes, sewage sludge, cropresidues, carbon laden industrial processing byproducts, and landfillmaterial have all been widely used.\\nAnaerobic digesters generally consist of an inlet, where the organic\\nresidues and other wastes are fed into the digester tank; a tank, in whichthe biomass is typically heated to increase its decomposition rate andpartially convert by bacteria into biogas; and an outlet where the biomassof the bacteria that carried out the process and non-digested materialremains as sludge and can be removed. The biogas produced can be burnedto provide energy for cooking and space heating or to generate electricity.Digestion has a low overall electrical efficiency (roughly 10–15 percent,strongly dependent on the feedstock) and is particularly suited for wetbiomass materials. Direct non-energy benefits are especially significant inthis process. The effluent sludge from the digester is a concentrated nitrogenfertilizer and the pathogens in the waste are reduced or eliminated by thewarm temperatures in the digester tank\\n[1].\\n6.1.4.

However, adapting liquid\\nbiofuels to our present day fuel infrastructure and engine technology has\\nproven to be nontrivial.\\nOnly oil producing plants, such as soybeans, palm oil trees and oilseeds\\nlike rapeseed can produce compounds similar to hydrocarbon petroleum\\nproducts, and have been used to replace small amounts of diesel. This\\n“biodiesel” has been marketed in Europe and to a lesser extent in the U.S.,but it requires substantial subsidies to compete with diesel.\\nOther alternative biofuels to petroleum-based fuels are alcohols produced\\nfrom biomass, which can replace gasoline or kerosene. The most widely\\nproduced today is ethanol from the fermentation of biomass. In\\nindustrialized countries ethanol is most commonly produced from food cropslike corn, while in the developing world it is produced from sugarcane. Its\\nmost prevalent use is as a gasoline fuel additive to boost octane levels or to\\nreduce dependence on imported fossil fuels. In the U.S. and Europe theethanol production is still far from competitive when compared to gasoline\\nand diesel prices, and the overall energy balance of such systems has not\\nbeen very favorable. The Brazilian Proalcool ethanol program, initiated in1975, has been successful due to the high productivity of sugarcane,\\nalthough subsidies are still required. Two other potential transportation\\nbiofuels are methanol and hydrogen. They are both produced via biomass\\ngasification and may be used in future fuel cells.\\nWhile ethanol production from maize and sugarcane, both agricultural\\ncrops, has become widespread and occasionally successful it can suffer from\\ncommodity price fluctuation relative to the fuels market.\\nConsequently, the production of ethanol from lignocellulosic biomass\\n(such as wood, straw and grasses) is being given serious attention. Inparticular, it is thought that enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass\\nwill open the way to low cost and efficient production of ethanol. While the\\ndevelopment of various hydrolysis techniques has gained attention in recentyears, particularly in Sweden and the United States, cheap and efficient\\nhydrolysis processes are still under development and some fundamental\\nissues need to be resolved. Once such technical barriers are surmountedand ethanol production can be combined with efficient electricity production\\nfrom unconverted wood fractions (like the lignin), ethanol costs could come\\nclose to current gasoline prices and overall system efficiencies could go upto about 70 percent (low heating value).

GEOTHERMAL ENERGY\\nGeothermal energy uses heat from the earth’s internal geologic processes\\nin order to produce electricity or provide heating. One source of geothermalenergy is steam. Groundwater percolates down though cracks in thesubsurface rocks until it reaches rocks heated by underlying magma, andthe heat converts the water to steam. Sometimes this steam makes its wayback to the surface in the form of a geyser or hot spring. Wells can be dugto tap the steam reservoir and bring it to the surface, to drive generatingturbines and produce electricity. Hot water can be circulated to heatbuildings. Regions near tectonic plate boundaries have the best potentialfor geothermal activity.\\nThe western portion of the United States is most conducive for\\ngeothermal energy sources, and over half of the electricity used by the cityof San Francisco comes from the Geysers, a natural geothermal field inNorthern California. California produces about 50 percent of the world’selectricity that comes from geothermal sources.\\nEntire cities in Iceland, which is located in a volcanically active region\\nnear a mid ocean ridge, are heated by geothermal energy. The Rift Valleyregion of East Africa also has geothermal power plants. Geothermal energymay not always be renewable in a particular region if the steam is\\nwithdrawn at a rate faster than it can be replenished, or if the heating\\nsource cools off. The energy produced by the Geysers region of California is\\nalready in decline because the heavy use is causing the underground heat\\nsource to cool.\\nGeothermal energy recovery can be less environmentally invasive than\\nengaging in recovery methods for non-renewable energy sources. Althoughit is relatively environmentally friendly, it is not practical for all situations.Only limited geographic regions are capable of producing geothermal energythat is economically viable. Therefore, it will probably never become a majorsource of energy.\\nGlobal geothermal technical potential is comparable to global primary\\nenergy supply in 2008. For electricity generation, the technical potentialof geothermal energy is estimated to be between 118 EJ/yr (to 3 km depth)and 1,109 EJ/yr (to 10 km depth). For direct thermal uses, the technicalpotential is estimated to range from 10 to 312 EJ/yr.\\nThe heat extracted to achieve these technical potentials can be fully or\\npartially replenished over the long term by the continental terrestrial heatflow of 315 EJ/yr at an average flux of 65 mW/m\\n2. Thus, technical potential\\nis not likely to be a barrier to geothermal deployment (electricity and directuses) on a global basis. Whether or not the geothermal technical potential\\nwill be a limiting factor on a regional basis depends on the availability of\\nEGS technology.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Ch-12greenenergy.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='332 Energy Sci. & Tech. Vol. 1: Opportunities and Challenges\\nThere are different geothermal technologies with distinct levels of\\nmaturity. Geothermal energy is currently extracted using wells or other\\nmeans that produce hot fluids from:\\n(a) Hydrothermal reservoirs with naturally high permeability; and\\n(b) EGS-type reservoirs with artificial fluid pathways. The technology\\nfor electricity generation from hydrothermal reservoirs is mature andreliable, and has been operating for more than 100 years. Technologiesfor direct heating using geothermal heat pumps (GHP) for districtheating and for other applications are also mature.\\nTechnologies for EGS are in the demonstration stage. Direct use provides\\nheating and cooling for buildings including district heating, fish ponds,greenhouses, bathing, wellness and swimming pools, water purification/desalination and industrial, and process heat for agricultural products andmineral drying.\\nGeothermal resources have been commercially used for more than a\\ncentury. Geothermal energy is currently used for base load electricgeneration in 24 countries, with an estimated 67.2 TWh/yr (0.24 EJ/yr) ofsupply provided in 2008 at a global average capacity factor of 74.5%; newergeothermal installations often achieve capacity factors above 90%.Geothermal energy serves more than 10% of the electricity demand in 6\\ncountries and is used directly for heating and cooling in 78 countries,\\ngenerating 121.7 TWh/yr (0.44 EJ/yr) of thermal energy in 2008, with GHPapplications having the widest market penetration. Another sourceestimates global geothermal energy supply at 0.41 EJ/yr in 2008.Environmental and social impacts from geothermal use are site andtechnology specific and largely manageable.\\nOverall, geothermal technologies are environmentally advantageous\\nbecause there is no combustion process emitting carbon dioxide (CO\\n2), with\\nthe only direct emissions coming from the underground fluids in thereservoir.\\nHistorically, direct CO\\n2 emissions have been high in some instances\\nwith the full range spanning from close to 0 to 740 g CO2/kWhe depending\\non technology design and composition of the geothermal fluid in theunderground reservoir.\\nDirect CO\\n2 emissions for direct use applications are negligible and EGS\\npower plants are likely to be designed with zero direct emissions. Life cycleassessment (LCA) studies estimate that full lifecycle CO\\n2 equivalent\\nemissions for geothermal energy technologies are less than 50 g CO2eq/\\nkWhe for flash steam geothermal power plants, less than 80 g CO2eq/kWhe\\nfor projected EGS power plants, and between 14 and 202 g CO2eq/kWhth\\nfor district heating systems and GHP.

Induced seismic events have not been large enough to\\nlead to human injury or relevant property damage, but proper managementof this issue will be an important step to facilitating significant expansionof future EGS projects.\\nSeveral prospects exist for technology improvement and innovation in\\ngeothermal systems. Technical advancements can reduce the cost ofproducing geothermal energy and lead to higher energy recovery, longerfield and plant lifetimes, and better reliability. In exploration, researchand development (R&D) is required for hidden geothermal systems ( i.e.,\\nwith no surface manifestations such as hot springs and fumaroles) and forEGS prospects. Special research in drilling and well construction technologyis needed to reduce the cost and increase the useful life of geothermalproduction facilities. EGS require innovative methods to attain sustained,commercial production rates while reducing the risk of seismic hazard.Integration of new power plants into existing power systems does notpresent a major challenge, but in some cases can require extending thetransmission network.\\nGeothermal-electric projects have relatively high upfront investment\\ncosts but often have relatively low Levelized costs of electricity (LCOE).Investment costs typically vary between USD2005 1,800 and 5,200 per\\nkW, but geothermal plants have low recurring ‘fuel costs’. The LCOE of\\npower plants using hydrothermal resources are often competitive in today’selectricity markets, with a typical range from US cents2005 4.9 to 9.2 perkWh considering only the range in investment costs provided above andmedium values for other input parameters; the range in LCOE across abroader array of input parameters is US cents2005 3.1 to 17 per kWh.These costs are expected to decrease by about 7% by 2020. There are noactual LCOE data for EGS power plants, as EGS plants remain in thedemonstration phase, but estimates of EGS costs are higher than those forhydrothermal reservoirs. The cost of geothermal energy from EGS plantsis also expected to decrease by 2020 and beyond, assuming improvementsin drilling technologies and success in developing well-stimulationtechnology. Fig. 4 shows schematic diagram of a geothermal binary-cyclepower plant.\\nCurrent levelized costs of heat (LCOH) from direct uses of geothermal\\nheat are generally competitive with market energy prices. Investment costsrange from USD2005 50 per kWth (for uncovered pond heating) to USD20053,940 per kWth (for building heating). Low LCOHs for these technologiesare possible because the inherent losses in heat-to electricity conversionare avoided when geothermal energy is used for thermal applications.\\nFuture geothermal deployment could meet more than 3% of global\\nelectricity demand and about 5% of the global demand for heat by 2050.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Ch-12greenenergy.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='334 Energy Sci. & Tech. Vol. 1: Opportunities and Challenges\\nEvidence suggests that geothermal supply could meet the upper range of\\nprojections derived from a review of about 120 energy and GHG reductionscenarios. With its natural thermal storage capacity, geothermal energy isespecially suitable for supplying base-load power. By 2015, geothermaldeployment is roughly estimated to generate 122 TWhe/yr (0.44 EJ/yr) for\\nelectricity and 224 TWhth/yr (0.8 EJ/yr) for heat applications. In the long\\nterm (by 2050), deployment projections based on extrapolations of long-term historical growth trends suggest that geothermal could produce 1,180TWhe/yr (~4.3 EJ/yr) for electricity and 2,100 TWhth/yr (7.6 EJ/yr) forheat, with a few countries obtaining most of their primary energy needs(heating, cooling and electricity) from geothermal energy. Scenario analysissuggests that carbon policy is likely to be one of the main driving factorsfor future geothermal development, and under the most favorable climatepolicy scenario (<440 ppm atmospheric CO\\n2 concentration level in 2100),\\ngeothermal deployment could be even higher in the near and long term.\\nIn 2009, the world’s top geothermal producer was the USA with almost\\n29% of the global installed capacity (3,094 MWe) as shown in Fig. 5. TheUS geothermal industry is currently expanding due to state RenewablePortfolio Standards (RPS) and various federal subsidies and tax incentives.US geothermal activity is concentrated in a few western states, and only afraction of the geothermal technical potential has been developed so far\\n[1][7]\\nand[8].\\n8. WAVE POWER\\nVery large energy fluxes can occur in deep water sea waves. The power in\\nthe wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude and to the period ofFig. 4:  Schematic diagram of a geothermal binary-cycle power plant[1]\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Ch-12greenenergy.pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content=' 335 Green Energy - An Introduction\\nFig. 5:  The world’s top geothermal producers\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Ch-12greenenergy.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='336 Energy Sci. & Tech. Vol. 1: Opportunities and Challenges\\nthe motion. Therefore the long period ~10 s, large amplitude ~2 m waves\\nhave considerable interest for power generation, with energy fluxes\\ncommonly averaging between 50 and 70 kWm–1 width of oncoming wave.\\nThe possibility of generating electrical power from these deep water\\nwaves has been recognized for many years, and there are countless ideasfor machines to extract the power. For example, a wave power system wasused in California in 1909 for harbour lighting. Modern interest has revived,particularly in Japan, the UK, Scandinavia and India, so research anddevelopment has progressed to commercial construction for meaningfulpower extraction. Very small scale autonomous systems are used for marinewarning lights on buoys and much larger devices for grid power generation.The provision of power for marine desalination is an obvious attraction. Aswith all renewable energy supplies, the scale of operation has to bedetermined, and present trends support moderate power generation atabout 100 kW–1MW from modular devices each capturing energy fromabout 5 to 25 m of wave front. Initial designs are for operation at shore-line or near to shore to give access and to lessen, hopefully, storm damage.\\nIt is important to appreciate the many difficulties facing wave power\\ndevelopments.\\n1. Wave patterns are irregular in amplitude, phase and direction. It is\\ndifficult to design devices to extract power efficiently over the wide\\nrange of variables.\\n2. There is always some probability of extreme gales or hurricanes\\nproducing waves of freak intensity. The structure of the power devicesmust be able to withstand this. Commonly the 50 year peak wave is10 times the height of the average wave. Thus the structures have towithstand ~100 times the power intensity to which they are normallymatched. Allowing for this is expensive and will probably reducenormal efficiency of power extraction.\\n3. Peak power is generally available in deep water waves from open-\\nsea swells produced from long fetches of prevailing wind, e.g., beyond\\nthe Western Islands of Scotland (in one of the most tempestuous areasof the North Atlantic) and in regions of the Pacific Ocean. Thedifficulties of constructing power devices for these types of waveregimes, of maintaining and fixing or mooring them in position, andof transmitting power to land, are fearsome. Therefore more protectedand accessible areas near to shore are most commonly used.\\n4. Wave periods are commonly ~5–10 s (frequency ~0.1 Hz). It is\\nextremely difficult to couple this irregular slow motion to electricalgenerators requiring ~500 times greater frequency.\\n5. So many types of device may be suggested for wave power extraction\\nthat the task of selecting a particular method is made complicated\\nand somewhat arbitrary.'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Ch-12greenenergy.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content=' 337 Green Energy - An Introduction\\n6. The large power requirement of industrial areas makes it tempting\\nto seek for equivalent wave energy supplies. Consequently plans may\\nbe scaled up so only large schemes are contemplated in the mostdemanding wave regimes. Smaller sites of far less power potential,but more reasonable economics and security, may be ignored.\\n7. The development and application of wave power has occurred with\\nspasmodic and changing government interest, largely without thebenefit of market incentives. Wave power needs the same learningcurve of steadily enlarging application from small beginnings thathas occurred with wind power\\n[6].\\n9. Recent progress in Renewable Energy System Cost and Performance\\nas previously described there has been significant progress in costreduction made by wind and PV systems, while biomass, geothermal,and solar thermal technologies are also experiencing cost reductions,and these are forecast to continue. Fig. 6 presents forecasts made bythe U.S. DOE for the capital costs of these technologies, from 1997 to2030.\\nOf course, capital costs are only one component of the total cost of\\ngenerating electricity, which also includes fuel costs, and operation andmaintenance costs. In general, renewable energy systems are characterizedby low or no fuel costs, although operation and maintenance (O&M) costscan be considerable. It is important to note, however, that O&M costs for\\nall new technologies are generally high, and can fall rapidly with increasingFig. 6: Capital cost forecasts for renewable energy technologies ( Source : U.S. DOE,\\n1997)\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Ch-12greenenergy.pdf', 'page': 23}, page_content='338 Energy Sci. & Tech.

Renewable energy systems such\\nas photovoltaics contain far fewer mechanically active parts than\\ncomparable fossil fuel combustion systems, and therefore are likely in thelong term to be less costly to maintain. Fig. 7 presents U.S. DOE projectionsfor the levelized costs of electricity production from these same renewableenergy technologies, from 1997 to 2030\\n[1].\\n10. SOME EXAMPLES OF THE SUCCESS OF RENEWABLES\\n• Spain generated more than half its electricity demand on 9 November\\n2009 with wind energy.\\n• Spain’s wind energy overtook coal as its third largest producer of\\npower in 2009.\\n• During 2010, China built roughly one windmill every hour.\\n• The wind industry installed just over 41,000 MW of new clean, reliable\\nwind power in 2011, bringing the total installed capacity globally tomore than 238,000 MW at the end of last year. This represents anincrease of 21%, with an increase in the size of the annual globalmarket of just over 6%.\\n• Today, about 75 countries worldwide have commercial wind power\\ninstallations, with 22 of them already passing the 1 gigawatt (GW)\\nlevel.Fig. 7: Levelized cost of electricity forecast for renewable energy technologies\\n(Source : U.S. DOE, 1997)\\n'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Ch-12greenenergy.pdf', 'page': 24}, page_content=' 339 Green Energy - An Introduction\\n• More than half of all new wind power was added outside the\\ntraditional markets of Europe and North American in 2010, for the\\nfirst time.\\n• New Zealand generates 10% of its electricity needs from geothermal\\npower.\\n• Portugal’s renewables went from 15% to 45% in its electricity grid in\\njust five years.\\nNuclear energy and the conflict with renewables\\nThe nuclear industry often claims that nuclear energy is needed to combat\\nclimate change. This is wrong. Research by Greenpeace and others showsthat continuing to operate nuclear plants prevents the large-scaleintegration of renewable energy into the electricity grid. Nuclear alsochannels investment away from renewables where investment can make adifference in fighting climate change.\\nThe argument that nuclear power could help fight climate change is\\nseriously flawed. If the entire global fleet of reactors was quadrupled, acompletely far-fetched scenario, this would lead to, at most, a 6% reductionin global CO\\n2 emissions, and only after 2020, well beyond the deadline that\\nclimate scientists have set for avoiding catastrophic climate change.\\nA key problem with nuclear power is that it must run around the clock\\nwith a constant output capacity, which is called ‘baseload’. The nuclearindustry presents this as an advantage, which it is not. First, a permanentpower generation mode–independent from the actual need in the powergrid is needed to generate as much electricity as possible to make generationcosts low. If the operational hours were reduced to half, the cost woulddouble. So the ‘base load’ strategy is more an economic than a technicalconcept.\\nSecond, unlike modern gas turbines, which can react within seconds to\\nfluctuating demand in the electricity grid, nuclear power stations are unableto react to the demand curve, and demand must follow the operation modeof nuclear power plants. This leads to the inefficient use of electricity. Inalmost all countries with a winter heating demand, a large share of nuclearin their power mix goes hand in hand with the expansion of highly inefficientelectrical heating systems. For example, France, with about 80% nuclearin its power mix, had an overall power demand of 101 GW on a cold day inFebruary 2012, while Germany, which has 15 million more people thanFrance, with 20% nuclear in its power mix had a demand of just over 50GW on the same cold day.\\nGermany has far better insulated houses and a significantly lower share\\nof electrical heating systems. The inflexibility of nuclear reactors has a'), Document(metadata={'source': '/content/pdfs/Ch-12greenenergy.pdf', 'page': 25}, page_content='340 Energy Sci. & Tech.

For technical and safety reasons, nuclear\\nplants cannot easily be turned down so wind operators are often told to\\nshut off their generators to give priority to electricity from nuclear plants,an economic and ecological mistake. As a result, nuclear energy blocks thedevelopment of renewable energy technologies by commandeering spaceon the electricity grid and reducing income for wind operators.\\nRenewable power plants can be built much more quickly than nuclear\\nand are safe. In addition, renewables can replace several times more of thecarbon that is leading to climate change for the same cost as nuclear andat a far faster pace.\\nAt present, over 90% of the Japan’s reactors are offline. The rest may\\nbe offline by May 2012. Given that only three of 54 reactors are operatingand there have been no significant problems with the electricity supply,Japan has shown that it can survive without nuclear power\\n[5],[9]&[10].\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] Antonia V.

INTRODUCTION\\nRenewable Energy RE is any form of energy from solar, geophysical or\\nbiological sources that is replenished by natural processes at a rate thatequals or exceeds its rate of use. RE is obtained from the continuing orrepetitive flows of energy occurring in the natural environment and includesresources such as biomass, solar energy, geothermal heat, hydropower,tide and waves, ocean thermal energy and wind energy. However, it ispossible to utilize biomass at a greater rate than it can grow or to drawheat from a geothermal field at a faster rate than heat flows can replenishit. On the other hand, the rate of utilization of direct solar energy has nobearing on the rate at which it reaches the Earth. Fossil fuels (coal, oil,natural gas) do not fall under this definition, as they are not replenishedwithin a time frame that is short relative to their rate of utilization.\\nRenewable energy sources are often considered alternative sources'),\n",

It’s convenient to use coal, oil, and natural gas for meeting ourenergy needs, but we have a limited supply of these fuels on the Earth.We’re using them much more rapidly than they are being created.Eventually, they will run out. And because of safety concerns and wastedisposal problems, the United States will retire much of its nuclear capacityby 2020. In the meantime, the nation’s energy needs are expected to growby 33 percent during the next 20 years. Renewable energy can help fill thegap.
